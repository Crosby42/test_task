Abstract: The promotion of hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs) has been proposed as one
promising solution for reducing transport energy consumption and mitigating vehicular
emissions in China. In this study, the energy and environmental impacts of hybrid and EVs
during 2010–2020 were evaluated through an energy conversion analysis and a life cycle
assessment (LCA), and the per-kilometer energy consumptions of gasoline, coal, natural
gas (NG), oil, biomass, garbage and electricity for EVs and HEVs were estimated. Results
show that the EVs and HEVs can reduce the energy consumption of vehicles by national
average ratios of 17%–19% and 30%–33%, respectively. The study also calculated the
detailed emission factors of SO2, NOX, VOC, CO, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, OC, EC, CO2, N2O,
CH4, Pb and Hg. It is indicated that the HEVs can bring significant reductions of NOX,
VOC and CO emissions and lesser decreases of SO2 and CO2 for a single vehicle. The EVs
could decrease many of the VOC, NH3, CO and CO2 emissions, but increase the SO2, NOX
and particles by 10.8–13.0, 2.7–2.9 and 3.6–11.5 times, respectively. In addition, the
electricity sources had significant influence on energy consumption (EC) and emissions. A
high proportion of coal-fired energy resulted in large ECs and emission factors. The total
energy consumption and pollutants emission changes in 2015 and 2020 were also
calculated. Based on the energy use and emission analysis of HEVs and EVs, it is
suggested that EVs should be promoted in the regions with higher proportions of

hydropower, natural gas-fired power and clean energy power, while HEVs can be widely
adopted in the regions with high coal-fired power ratios. This is to achieve a higher energy
consumption reduction and pollutant emission mitigation. Moreover, the results can also
provide scientific support for the total amount control of regional air pollutants in China.

1. Introduction
Motor vehicles represent a major oil consumption sector and their number has experienced a sharp
growth in China during the past decade. The number of vehicles has grown from 42 million in 2000 to
nearly 200 million in 2010, and as a consequence, the gasoline consumption has increased from
13.9 million tons in 2000 up to 32.0 million tons, which accounts for 46.5% of the total gasoline use in
2010 [1,2]. Furthermore, according to the previous studies this number may be even underestimated [3,4].
However, more than half (about 53.4%) of the crude oil used in China was imported from other
countries [5], and this high import ratio will greatly impact the energy security and economic
development of China, making the reduction of the gasoline consumption with the sharp increase of
vehicle numbers an important but difficult problem to solve. On the other hand, motor vehicles are also
a major contributor to the air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions [6,7], and it exert a significant
adverse influence on the air pollution and human health [8,9]. As a result, the mitigation of vehicular
emissions will play a vital role in the improvement of air quality and public health. However,
Lang et al. [10] found that although the implementations of numbers of emission mitigation measures
(such as the implementation of stringent vehicular emission standards, the elimination of high emission
vehicles, the development of public transport, and the enhancement of fuel quality) have produced
remarkable results in decreasing the level of most of the vehicular emissions, the rate decrease is still
proving to be slow and the level of some of the pollutants emissions has even gone up due to a rapid
growth in the vehicle population. Other control measures should be studied and implemented to
achieve a higher emission mitigation effect. In the context of saving transport energy consumption and
reducing air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) was
proposed as one effective solution to the high energy use and pollutant emission problems. Consequently,
the study of actual energy and environmental implications of EVs is of great importance and necessity,
in order to provide a scientific basis for the development of a strategy for promoting EVs.
A number of studies have been carried out worldwide to assess the impacts of hybrid and electric
vehicles on energy and environment. Campanari et al. [11] studied the energy balances for electric
vehicles using batteries and fuel cells based on a well-to-wheel (WTW) analysis and the ECE-EUDC
driving cycle simulations. The analysis showed that EVs equipped with fuel cells could give better
performance in the medium-to-long driving range than that of those with pure batteries. Stephan and
Sullivan [12] analyzed the environmental effect of promoting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)
in the United States and found that compared to the conventional HEVs, PHEVs could reduce 25% and
50% of CO2 emissions in the short term and in the long term, respectively. Hawkins et al. [13]
Energies 2013, 6 2665
synthesized the results of previous studies and compared the global warming potential (GWP) of EVs
and CGVs. It was concluded that although EVs could lead to a reduction of GWP compared to CGVs,
high efficiency CGVs and grid-independent HEVs perform better than EVs using coal-fired electricity.
Huo et al. [14] evaluated the potential impact of nine alternative vehicle/fuel systems on the
environment. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transport (GREET)
model was used to estimate the emissions of VOC, NOX, PM10, PM2.5 and CO of different alternative
systems by a life-cycle analysis. A few more studies were conducted on the EVs’ environment and
energy implications in China. Huo et al. [15] examined the fuel-cycle CO2, SO2 and NOX emissions of
EVs and found that if connected to the current electricity grid in China, EVs could produce higher SO2
and NOX emissions than those resulting from gasoline vehicles. Wu et al. [16] selected three developed
regions (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze-River-Delta and Pearl-River-Delta) in China and evaluated
the influences of EVs, HEVs and PHEVs in terms of their fossil energy consumptions and per-kilometer
CO2 emissions during 2010–2030. It was found that the promotion of PHEVs and EVs could help cut
per-kilometer petroleum use to a great extent; however, it makes the CO2 emission mitigation becomes
even more difficult to achieve. The evaluation of HEVs emissions were also studied in [17].
However, most of the previous studies focus on limited types of the powers or pollutants. It is
necessary to conduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the energy and environment
implications for EVs and HEVs through a life cycle assessment (LCA) in China. The purpose of this
study is to estimate the energy and environment impacts from the view points of different power
generation methods and various pollutants in the city driving condition. The considering internal
combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) were new conventional light duty gasoline vehicles (CGVs)
(compact cars). Emissions and energy consumptions of five types of power generation methods (including
coal-, natural gas (NG)-, oil-, biomass- and garbage-powers) were considered. The per-kilometer
energy consumption (PKEC) of gasoline, coal, NG, oil, biomass, garbage and electricity of EVs and
HEVs were calculated. Emission factors of four main categories and 14 sub-categories were estimated,
including gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOX, VOC, CO and NH3), particles (PM10, PM2.5, OC and EC),
greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O and CH4) and heavy metals (Pb and Hg). Furthermore, the total energy
consumption and emission changes caused by the penetration of EVs and HEVs in 2015 and 2020 in
China were evaluated. The results can provide scientific support for the policy of wide-spread adoption
of EVs and HEVs. The detailed PKEC for different fuels and the emission factors of various pollutants
can also provide sound basic data for relevant studies on vehicles and transport.
2. Data and Methodology
2.1. Electricity Generation in China
The electricity consumption in China has increased rapidly in recent years. It grew from 1360 TWh
in 2000 to 4200 TWh in 2010. This rapid growth of electricity demand has resulted in a corresponding
increase in electricity production. The electricity production and installed capacity have reached
4219 TWh and 960 GW in 2010, which were 308% and 301% of those in 2000, respectively [18,19].
Based on the differences of energy sources, there are basically five electricity generation methods:
hydropower, fuel-fired power (including coal, oil, NG, biomass, garbage and other fuels), nuclear
power, wind power and others (mainly include geothermal, tidal and solar power generations).
Energies 2013, 6 2666
Among all these electricity generation methods, fuel-fired power was the dominant one, accounting
for 80.8% of the total electricity production and 67.3% of the total installed capacity in 2010 (see
Figure 1). In particular, coal was the main fuel used and the proportions of coal-fired power in the total
electricity production and in the total installed capacity were 76.2 and 67.3%, respectively. The ratios
of oil-, NG-, biomass- and garbage-fired power were 0.4%, 1.8%, 0.2% and 1.1% of the total
electricity production, and 0.9%, 2.8%, 0.2% and 1.0% of the total installed capacity, respectively.
Hydropower was another important contributor to the electricity production in China. It accounted for
16.3% of the total electricity production and 22.5% of the total installed capacity in 2010. In the three
typical regions—Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta
(PRD), the proportions of coal- and natural gas-fired power were 94.8% and 0.8%, 86.5% and 2.2%,
60.2% and 3.1%, respectively.

The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) and transmission efficiency (TE) are important parameters
for estimating the energy consumption and emissions of EVs. The coal consumption rates were 0.367,
0.357, 0.349 and 340 gce/kWh (gram of standard coal equivalent per kWh) in 2006, 2007, 2008 and
2010, respectively [20,21]. The calorific values (CVs) of coal equivalent and electricity are 29,271 kJ/kg
and 3,600 kJ/kWh, respectively. As a result, the ECE in coal power generation was about 36.2% in
2010. The coal consumption can decrease to 330 g/kWh and the ECE will become 37.3% in 2015 [21].
Based on the change trends of the ECE during the past several years, we assumed the ECE will
increase to 39.9% in 2020. The value was between the ECE of India (38.8%) and Japan (42.0%) in
2008 [22]. The ECEs of NG, oil, biomass and garbage in 2010 were 41.4, 37.0, 29.5 and 17.0%,
respectively [22–24]. The ECEs of these fuels in 2015 and 2020 were estimated based on the ECEs in
2010 and the ECE change rates of coal in 2010, 2015 and 2020, due to the lack of the study on the
ECEs of NG-, oil-, biomass- and garbage-fired electricity in the future of China. Many measures will
be adopted to improve the ECE in power generation [19]. For example, the power generation units
with small installed capacities and low ECE will be gradually closed down in the following decade.
Advanced technologies and new equipments which can increase the ECE will also be used in the new
power plants. These will help to improve the energy conversion efficiency of power generation to a
Energies 2013, 6 2667
great extent. The ECEs of coal and other fuels are listed in Table 1. The TE in China has been increasing
during the past several years, from 92.30% in 2000 to 93.47% in 2010 [18,19], and by taking measures
such as optimizing the power distribution and sources network and improving the running mode, the
TE will grow up to about 93.50% in 2015 [21]. The value in 2020 was also assumed as 93.50%.

maximum, minimum and mean values of the fuel consumptions in 2015 and 2020, respectively;
ENGf,2015 represents the fuel consumption for a single vehicle (g/km); VKT is the annual average travel
mileages of a single vehicle that can be replaced by EVs or HEVs (km); P2015 is the number of EVs or
HEVs. The VKT of CGVs and HEVs was about 19,134 km in 2010 [29]. This is much higher than that
in the developed countries, which are mainly with a range of 10,000–18,000 km, due to the lower
private car (PC) ownership rate (vehicles/1000 people) [30]. With the increasing PC ownership rate
and the development of public transport, the frequency of PC usage will decrease [10,30] and the VKT
for PCs can be expected to be 18,000 km in 2015 and 16,787 km in 2020 [29]. As for the EVs, the
VKT was about 15,856 km (9910 miles), which was obtained based on real world driving
data [31]. This value was less than that for the PC. Their limited range will have significant effects on
the purchase intention of consumers and the penetration of EVs. However, the differences will change
to become smaller and the influence of VKT will become lesser. In addition, the charging infrastructure
construction and longer battery charging time could also affect the promotion of EVs. For the vehicle
numbers, according to the Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicles Development Planning
(2012–2020) document [26], the total numbers of EVs and HEVs in China in 2015 and 2020 should
reach 500 thousand and five million, respectively. In this study, we will assess the energy and
environmental implications of the electric vehicles promotion policy based on these two vehicle numbers.
2.3. Emission Calculation
The air pollutants, particles, greenhouse gases and heavy metals emission factors of CGVs, HEVs
and EVs were calculated based on the energy consumption and the corresponding emission factors of
fuel combustions, as shown in the following equations:
EF ENG EF EF CGVs p f f p P T p CGVs U , ,,& , , =× + (11)
EF ENG EF EF EF HEVs p f f p P T p HEVs U p B P , ,,& , , , =× + + − (12)
,, ,,& ,, , ( ) EF ENG EF EF EF EVs f p f f p P T f p U p B P =× + + − (13)
where subscript f includes coal, NG, oil, biomass and garbage; subscript p includes four main
categories and 14 sub-categories, which are gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOX, VOC, CO and NH3),
particles (PM10, PM2.5, OC and EC), greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O and CH4) and heavy metals (Pb and
Hg); EFEVs,f,p is the emission factor of electric vehicles using the electricity generated by a certain kind
of fuel combustion (g/km); ENGf is the fuel consumption for a single vehicle (kg/km or m3
/km), which
was calculated in Section 2.2; EFf,p,P&T and EFf,p,U are the emission factors during the stage of fuel
production & transportation and usage (g/kg or g/m3
), EFp,CGVs,U, EFp,HEVs,U and EFp,B–P are the
emission factors of driving CGVs, driving HEVs and lithium-ion battery production, (g/km). The
EFf,p,P&T and EFf,p,U are summarized and estimated based on previous studies, as shown in Tables 7 and 8.
In addition to the emissions during the fuels production, transportation and usage, the production of
battery is another substantial emission source in the life cycle of EVs [32]. Previous study indicated
that the energy consumption of lithium-ion batteries for HEVs are 5.7 kJ/km coal, 3.9 kJ/km NG and
Energies 2013, 6 2670
2.0 kJ/km petroleum, which were directly obtained from the GREET model calculation (based on a
U.S. grid mix) [33]. In order to reduce the effect caused by the limited range in the EVs’ promotion to
the greatest extent, it is assumed that the EVs were with battery packs sized for 240 km of usable
electric energy, and the energy consumptions for EVs were about 31.8 times of those for HEVs [32].
Based on the corresponding CVs (Table 6) and emission factors (EFs) of combustion (Table 7) of
different fuels, the EFp,B–P of lithium-ion battery production can be estimated. As for the CGVs and
HEVs, because that the Euro III emission standard was being implemented in 2010 and the Euro IV
and Euro V standards are expected to be implemented during the periods of 2010–2015 and 2015–2020,
the emission factors of CGVs with Euro III, Euro IV and Euro V emission standards will be used to be
compared with these of the EVs and HEVs in 2010, 2015 and 2020. The emission factors (EFs) of
CGVs and HEVs were calculated by the EU’s COPERT IV model, which is thought more appropriate
for China [10,34]. Driving condition was an important parameter for the COPERT model. In this study,
we estimated the EFs of CGVs and HEVs under the city driving condition. And the average speed was
assumed as 20 km/h [34]. The EFp,CGVs,U, EFp,HEVs,U and EFp,B–P are listed in Table 8.
The method for calculating pollutants emissions is similar with that for the total energy
consumption described in Section 2.2. The total pollutants emissions of vehicles can be estimated by
the Equations (14)–(19):
EMI EF VKT P p p ,2015,min ,2015 2015 2015 = ×× (14)
EMI EF VKT P p p ,2015,max ,2010 2015 2015 = ×× (15)

where EMIp,2015,min, EMIp,2015,max, EMIp,2015 and EMIp,2020,min, EMIp,2020,max, EMIp,2020 are the maximum,
minimum and mean values of the total pollutant emissions in 2015 and 2020; EFp,2015 represents the
pollutant emission factors considering the actual electricity generation ratios of various fuels (g/km);
the meaning of VKT and P are the same as the description in Section 2.2.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Energy Implications of HEVs and EVs
3.1.1. Per-Kilometer Energy Consumption
Based on the method proposed in Section 2.2, the energy consumptions (ECs) for a single vehicle
were calculated. As shown in Figure 2, with the development of vehicle technology, the energy
consumptions of CGVs, HEVs and EVs will be decreasing in the future, by 6.1%–9.7% during
2010–2015 and 8.5%–10.7% during 2015–2020. The increase of energy conversion efficiencies in the
power generation process and the decrease of electricity transmission loss will also contribute to the
reduction of the energy consumptions for EV
